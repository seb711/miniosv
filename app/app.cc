// The OSv application.
//
// Unlike upstream OSv, the application is not a separate ELF shared object
// loaded at runtime from a filesystem image. It is compiled and statically
// linked directly into the kernel image (app.o in loader.elf). The kernel
// calls osv_app_main() once, after early initialization, on a dedicated thread.
//
// This is a minimal "hello world" placeholder: it prints a greeting and powers
// the machine off so a run exits cleanly. The conformance and stress suites
// that used to live here now build with `make app=tests` (see test/).
