/*
 * In-kernel test application.
 *
 * Built instead of the normal application with `make app=tests`. Like any
 * application it is statically linked into the kernel image and entered through
 * osv_app_main(). It drives the two correctness suites that live under apps/:
 *
 *   - os-features: walks the full list of OS facilities the slimmed kernel is
 *                  supposed to support and checks each behaves (conformance).
 *   - os-libc:     covers the plain C libc surface (string/stdlib/stdio/math,
 *                  qsort, setjmp, errno, calendar time) (conformance).
 *   - os-stress:   hammers threads, the allocator, TLS, synchronization, files
 *                  and IPC concurrently to shake out races (stress).
 *
 * Both used to be standalone PIE programs with their own main(); those entry
 * points are renamed (os_features_main / os_stress_main) and invoked here.
